        <p>I rarely change my workspace but I am at the point where I feel comfortable
with my workspace (again).</p>
<h2 id="tmux">Tmux</h2><p>I was really hesitant to use tmux since all I believed tmux was for
only splitting terminals but oh boy I was wrong. Yes it splits terminal
and creates new window but its more than that: its how you can sit in one
terminal and control all others terminals. I no longer have to golf through
terminals to find the one I am searching for. No more moving terminal to
background workspace, no more spawning new terminal to compile my code,
no more terminal golfing now.  That being said, one of my big issue with
tmux is its sixel support. Although tmux supports sixel I could not output
a proper sixel pane through nnn. This is a bit problematic when I want to
change wallpapers on the fly but it is what it is.</p>
<p>After setting the prefix key to M-x I feel more emacs&rsquo;y as well. +1</p>
<h2 id="hyprland">Hyprland</h2><p>Hyprland is nothing new to me. I&rsquo;ve been using it ever since I stopped using
sway. Sway is good but hyprland is just better. And the support for shaders was
exactly what I needed. I am a huge fan of monochrome colors. Its not that it
looks good (I don&rsquo;t want to get achromatopsia) but monochrome colors keeps
me focused on a single thing. I can open tmux, change color to monochrome and
ignore every other possibility to get distracted. And which window manager
lets you write your own shader? <strong>None</strong></p>
<h2 id="typst">Typst</h2><p>I have begun write my notes using typst. This thing is really comfortable.
Converting my shitty typst file to a template took me couple of minutes
and I kept changing it as I began to use that template. I am pleased
with this. All the horrors of writing my own pdf has disappeared, now I
just need to focus on typing.  If you&rsquo;ve ever used latex watch this -&gt;

<p>my github gist for a comfy template: <a href="https://gist.github.com/luitel777/cd15b946df437b1e6d9226986726de3c">https://gist.github.com/luitel777/cd15b946df437b1e6d9226986726de3c</a></p>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2><p>No one really uses windows anyway. I&rsquo;ve configured tailscale on my linux so
when opening wsl, it automatically fires up tailscale and makes a ssh
connection to my linux no matter where I am at. Although most of the time
I don&rsquo;t run my tailscale on my main desktop when I need to tailscale becomes
a godsent.</p>
<p>Also windows power tool is actually good. Just the keyboard remapping ability
makes me write code on windows. Other than that I think windows just moves
very slow to me as I find it harder to adapt.</p>
