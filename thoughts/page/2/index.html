		So I finished prison school and it was my worst decision.
I still can&rsquo;t get over that Chiyo is old Miyo now.
I wished Hana won which she technically did but not like this.
I had a feeling if Hana won Chiyo would be sad but what Hana and Kiyoshi did Chiyo in her birthday broke her.
That last panel will haunt me forever. Thanks Akira Hiramoto.
Will I read next manga Raw Hero by Akira Hiramoto which I presume made him rush prison school to the point its ending is like a plane disappearing in midway flight?

		Dabbled with plan9. I am not sure I like it. I will give it try again another time.
Dabbled with latex. I absolutely love it. Time to write something that I will be too embarrassed to make public.
Dabbled with reactjs due to antjs. I am learning react just to use that antjs components.
I think I have a project in mind that I will do after my exams. A habit tracker to make me feel good and productive.

		IntroductionJigokuraku written by Yuji Kaku is a supernatural manga. This manga takes best of both Japanese era as it takes place in edo period and Chinese religion called Taoism. Our main protagonist is a cold hearted ninja named Gabimaru &ldquo;Gabimaru the hollow&rdquo;.
TitleLets talk about the title first. Jigokuraku literally means &ldquo;Jigoku&rdquo;-&gt;Hell &amp; &ldquo;Gokuraku&rdquo;-&gt;Heaven/paradise translated in english its Hell&rsquo;s Paradise. Considering the story takes place where there exists immortal gods this title is simple and straightforward.

		2022 was hell of an year for my anime catalog
Urusei YatsuraThis has to be one of my best slice of life shows. This anime is relaxing to watch and the characters are is so cuteee especially Lum. I just hope the story will progress. New character are introduced every ep but their development is kinda slow to the point where its nonexistent but I guess thats one downside of slice of life anime.

		Compilers are smart these days. You don&rsquo;t have to learn assembly but knowing them will certainly help anyone to see what the compiler is doing. I believe you learn assembly by referencing. There are so many opcodes/instructions that one might go crazy remembering them all. My preferred way is using spooky internet to look up the opcodes you don&rsquo;t know. The referencing method. There are so many things one need to know to program assembly but understanding basic compiler generated assembly needs mostly reference and assumptions.

		Tl;dr stop social media. Its meaningless and will ruin you internally like a plague.
IntroductionI&rsquo;ve been restricting myself from social media these days. This includes all my online activity including youtube. Its all meaningless. Most people don&rsquo;t find joy using social platforms, its just because they are bored. I unknowingly became those npc. This is my way of taking my life back from this validation loop.
What is social media?Thing that puts you in a fake validation loop to make you think that you are/have/will/might achieve something when in fact you ultimately do nothing and scroll a 50mb app and wait for something to happen so you could cure and grow your boredom.

		Horror of forcing animation to 60fps
1st scene is 60fps created mix not available on original 24
creating by mixing before and after frames of 24fps and putting it in middle (I guess)
certainly smooth but not ideal for proper viewing, you need to force your brain to ignore shitty frames like this created by forced 60fps. Human eyes and brain are werid
Just something to say because I don&rsquo;t want to study for exams tomorrow
