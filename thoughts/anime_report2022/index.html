        <p>2022 was hell of an year for my anime catalog</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="urusei-yatsurahttpsanilistcoanime143277urusei-yatsura-2022"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/143277/Urusei-Yatsura-2022/">Urusei Yatsura</a></h2><p>This has to be one of my best slice of life shows. This anime is relaxing to watch and the
characters are is so cuteee especially Lum. I just hope the story will
progress. New character are introduced every ep but their development is kinda
slow to the point where its nonexistent but I guess thats one downside of slice
of life anime. That being said their song is absolute banger. Do not skip it!</p>
<h2 id="yojouhan-time-machinehttpsanilistcoanime137819yojouhan-time-machine-blues"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/137819/Yojouhan-Time-Machine-Blues/">Yojouhan Time Machine</a></h2><p>If you are fan of <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/7785/Yojouhan-Shinwa-Taikei/">Yojouhan Shinwa Takei</a> or
<a href="https://anilist.co/anime/97917/Yoru-wa-Mijikashi-Arukeyo-Otome/">Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome</a> you
will love this show as much as I did. This show is not best or mind blowing as in its original series
but this show will certainly keep you entertained. Its relatively short featuring only 6 eps but
it has a good concept like its originals.</p>
<h2 id="chainsaw-manhttpsanilistcoanime127230chainsaw-man"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/127230/Chainsaw-Man/">Chainsaw Man</a></h2><p>I enjoyed this anime and it was a banger like I expected. They used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping">rotoscoping</a>
which contributed to some great fight scene. Overall great action anime with relatively new concept.</p>
<h2 id="bocchi-the-rockhttpsanilistcoanime130003bocchi-the-rock"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/130003/Bocchi-the-Rock/">Bocchi The Rock</a></h2><p>The anime of 2022. I watched this from its 1st release thinking I would just drop this like any other
hitoribocchi shows but holy heckk this exceeded my expectation. For some reason I was carving for next
episode every week. The animation is so wacky I love it, I love the expressions of bocchi and I love her imagination.
Its also fun to watch the struggles and progress of an overexaggerated hitoribocchi. I don&rsquo;t feel bad, kek.</p>
<h2 id="lycoris-recoilhttpsanilistcoanime143270lycoris-recoil"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/143270/Lycoris-Recoil/">Lycoris Recoil</a></h2><p>Another great anime I was not expecting. I absolutely loved the voice acting of
<a href="https://anilist.co/staff/106030/Chika-Anzai">Chika Anzai</a> and to me great va
are the only reason to watch anime sometime&hellip; but this anime is fun to watch.
Its simply fun. Story is not that good to the point where I straight don&rsquo;t
like it. That being said I really loved how Takina was being close to Chisato
slowly by slowly. It has a well made character development.</p>
<h2 id="summer-time-renderhttpsanilistcoanime129201summer-time-render"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/129201/Summer-Time-Render/">Summer Time Render</a></h2><p>Great mystery anime that forced me to read manga after 3ep. Watch this without getting spoiled. Its a fun anime
about people having fun on summer weekends.</p>
<h2 id="kage-no-jitsuryokusha-ni-naritakutehttpsanilistcoanime130298kage-no-jitsuryokusha-ni-naritakute"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/130298/Kage-no-Jitsuryokusha-ni-Naritakute/">Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!</a></h2><p>If you are not watching this then what are you even doing in your life. This should be the best isekai
ever made. Current latest manga readers would know that its not exactly isekai looking at the conditions
but ahem. This anime is cringy and makes no sense but its literally how you are supposed to watch it. The
main character is the most perfect and well designed character for this show. The show is exaggerated but
the manga is even more exaggerated. Just pick your poison and start watching/reading this show. All I can
say is its hella fun.</p>
<h2 id="vanitas-no-catre-2httpsanilistcoanime135136vanitas-no-carte-part-2"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/135136/Vanitas-no-Carte-Part-2/">Vanitas no catre 2</a></h2><p>Sequel of <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/131646/Vanitas-no-Carte/">Vanitas no carte</a> this show is about vampires on
mid-european era. Everything on this show seems like tailored to me. The main character Vanitas is doctor saving the vampire
and his girlfriend Jeanne who accidentally loves him. The romance is cute, &ldquo;Jeanne is CUTE&rdquo;, its intriguing and charming in its
ways and the story and character pacing is also great. And no there is no BL even though Noe sometime
acts like one. All the characters are designed great so you will have special attachment to some characters. My favourite
characters became Domninique and Jeanne as they act so cute and have their own set of problems.</p>
<h2 id="sono-bisque-dollhttpsanilistcoanime132405sono-bisque-doll-wa-koi-wo-suru"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/132405/Sono-Bisque-Doll-wa-Koi-wo-Suru/">Sono Bisque Doll</a></h2><p>If you are into romance sure you might like it. But wimpy main character are just not that great to me. Kitagawa
is polar opposite of Gojou which singlehandedly backs up the anime.</p>
<h2 id="spy-familyhttpsanilistcoanime140960spyfamily"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/140960/SPYFAMILY/">Spy Family</a></h2><p>If you like a mind reading kid, assassin and special agent living together on mid-european era then yea this show
might be for you. (European set is better in Vanitas. Cocky fyi by me). Nonetheless its fun to watch but
it falls flat as you watch. It becomes repititive and you kinda know what happens next.</p>
<h2 id="hataraku-maou-samahttpsanilistcoanime130592hataraku-maousama"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/130592/Hataraku-Maousama/">Hataraku Maou Sama</a></h2><p>Like spy if you like demon and angels living in human world catering a kid doing normal things then yea you
might like it but it had same problem like spy had.</p>
<p>Released before 2022 but I watched in 2022</p>
<h2 id="space-dandyhttpsanilistcoanime20057spacedandy"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/20057/SpaceDandy/">Space Dandy</a></h2><p>If you told me that I copied space warrior from Dandy I would not care. Not because really I don&rsquo;t care,
its just because I absolutely love spacedandy. Its wacky, its funny, its crazy,
I just love everything about this show. Dandy and his crazy adventure to become
rich as alien hunters and all the thing he does is just made PERFECTLY.
10/10 would rewatch again this year.</p>
<h2 id="workinghttpsanilistcoanime6956working"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/6956/Working/">Working</a></h2><p>As it became more an more obvious who was gonna become the Katanashi&rsquo;s lover,
my fear was growing bigger and bigger. My inner monster was feeding on that fear. I could not
sleep and think straight for days after it struck my head. Anyways fun show.
I hatethatgirl.</p>
<h2 id="ika-musumehttpsanilistcoanime8557shinryaku-ika-musume"><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/8557/Shinryaku-Ika-Musume/">Ika Musume</a></h2><p>A squid girl who came to destroy humanity but got forced to work on some shop. This show is cute, relatable
and fun laid back show. Really fun anime.</p>
