        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Paradise:_Jigokuraku">Jigokuraku</a>
written by Yuji Kaku is a supernatural manga. This manga takes
best of both Japanese era as it takes place in edo period and Chinese
religion called Taoism. Our main protagonist is a cold hearted ninja named
Gabimaru &ldquo;Gabimaru the hollow&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="title">Title</h2><p>Lets talk about the title first. Jigokuraku literally means
&ldquo;Jigoku&rdquo;-&gt;Hell &amp; &ldquo;Gokuraku&rdquo;-&gt;Heaven/paradise translated in english its
Hell&rsquo;s Paradise. Considering the story takes place where there exists
immortal gods this title is simple and straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2><p>The story takes place on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period">edo</a>
period somewhere in Japan. The depiction of that era is pretty well made.
With addition to the harsh ruling in edo period it also shows us how the
concept of life was in the edo period. It was normal for people to commit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku">seppuku</a> and have family of
neck choppers. There is a manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Executioner">Samurai
Executioner</a> whose story
revolves around a guy &ldquo;Yamada Asaemon&rdquo; but weridly enough Gintama also has
a girl from Asaemon family and this manga has also neck chopper family of
Asaemon. I don&rsquo;t know if Asaemon were real family or just reference from that
manga but it sure seems interesting.
<img src="./jigokuraku_rakugo_decapitation.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is one of my absolute best panels from the manga. Its subtle and
has no effect on the plot whatsoever but this panel will keep us in check
with the edo period and types of people that will get introduced in future.
It also sets the expectations about the character.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="story">Story</h2><p>Gabimaru was not immortal, he had no meaning for his life yet he
could not be executed. He would
not care less if he was killed yet he was resisting subconsciously.
Unknowing to Gabimaru, he loved his wife. Love was changing him with introducing
emotions to the hollow man. His hineous act of murder was sentenced to
death from Sagiri Asaemon but getting the seed of immortality would
pardon his sentence and return to his wife. Thus the journey continues on
island where that supposedly seed of immortality was present. He was to
take Sagiri, his executioner. This same task were given to other
criminals as well.</p>
<p><img src="./jigokuraku_peh.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The island looked like paradise yet no man returned after entering the island.
Those who returned were dead bodies, they were converted to &ldquo;Tao&rdquo; which seemed
to be a source of immortality.</p>
<p>According to Taosim the body and the mind are formed by Tao. This piece of text
is very vital for the story. The manga actually uses this concept heavily as
all immortality is the Tao remaking their bodies. The manga also says that
meditation and certain breathing techniques allow to achieve immortality called
the way of tan. This might be far fetched but Taoism do actually believe in
spiritual immortality mostly referring to Xian. Xian being refered as Sennin in
the Manga are the antagonist of the story with Tensen being the highest ranking
Sennin. They are the seemingly &ldquo;immortals&rdquo; in the manga. They lived for
centuries and can use Tao to regenerate themself.</p>
<p>Jigokuraku has very natural and well designed characters. Viz let the author
draw whatever the heck he wanted and the author did a very good job of
potraying the characters.</p>
<h2 id="gabimaru">Gabimaru</h2><p>Gabimaru sentenced to death by Asaemon Sagiri is a ruthless but skilled ninja.
He took this challenge just to see his wife, Yui. As the story progresses
Gabimaru was changing not only from the harsh journey but also from Sagiri. We
will come to that later. From the experiences he learned what he really wanted,
it was to be free from all these killings and live a normal life with his wife.
This resolve made him softer and more humane to the point he hesitated to kill
Tensen. Once Yuzuriha made a concept of how Gabimaru&rsquo;s wife might not be real
since she is daughter of Ninja leader who might be manipulating Gabimaru. But
this does not let his resolve die. He does not let that concept weaken him as
he belived in his wife. Later in the story we find our that Gabimaru is the
title given to the most ruthless ninja. Passing the title includes killing the
precedence Gabimaru.</p>
<h2 id="asaemon-sagiri">Asaemon Sagiri</h2><p>Another character I absolutely love. She comes from Asaemon family. Unlike
Gabimaru she had no resolve. She was normal but strict girl who wanted to
improve in her occupation of behading. She had weakness due to which she lacked
confidence. I think this really shows how we humans are and how we relate to
Sagiri. That being said Gabimaru always thought her of being strong, stronger
than himself despite the advantage in physical bodies. Upon the adventure she
slowly realizes what a person can do and you have to live with it. In final
volume she says she was attached Gabimaru meaning she no longer saw Gabimaru as
criminal but as a friend.</p>
<p><img src="./jigokuraku_sagiri.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-asaemon-family">The Asaemon family</h2><p>Each Asaemon had different personality. Some were too righteous, some were too
laid back and some did not want to be Asaemon. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about all
the Asaemons but there are some that you will love and relate to.</p>
<p>Shugen is too righteous, he is extreme. Rumors had he not only decapitated the
crimimal but his whole generation from the old to an infant baby. He supported
Sagiri and all the other Asaemon and his extreme resolve made him too powerful.
In ending volume we can see that Shugen accepts new Sagiri as she and Gabimaru
fought together.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Such unpleasantness could not be avoided. Your execution alone would not
stop your wicked ways from being carried on by your relations. The blame in
such cases lies not only with the corrupt soul of a single man but also with
the environment that produced him.”</strong></em><br>
Taken from <a href="https://jigokuraku.fandom.com/wiki/Yamada_Asaemon_Shugen">https://jigokuraku.fandom.com/wiki/Yamada_Asaemon_Shugen</a></p>
<p>Another Asaemon I really like is Jikka. He is useless. His personality is
uncanningly funny. When he realizes that fighting immortals and winning is
impossible feat, he just drinks some more booze and cheers to the death of
humanity. He is not evil by any means, in fact he is one of the reason why
Gabimaru and other criminals were not executed. Tl;dr he fooled the shogun.</p>
<h2 id="criminals">Criminals</h2><p>The criminals were thrown into an impossible feat of defeating immortals.
Some died before returning to the island some were killed by Asaemons.</p>
<p>One criminal I really like is Aza Chobei. He is the bandit leader, with his
small brother who infiltrated the Asaemon family his plan was to live free.
Finding the immortality and giving it to shogun? No. If he found that he would
just gulp all of it himself. Despite being ruthless criminal he loved his
brother. He partnered with Tensen if his brother was not harmed but instead of
Sennin betraying him, he betrayed Sennin. Thats how ruthless this guy is!
His ability to adapt to situations made him stronger and live how he see fit.</p>
<p>Another one is Yuzuriha. She is a shinobi. She was selfish. As a shinobi
her fundamentals of life was to live without any danger&hellip; despite being a
shinobi. As manga progresses she becomes very fond of Sagiri and decides
to go on a journey with her. I find her really cute and her seemingly
innocent personality is really enjoyable to read. Later in chapter
she nearly sacrifies herself to help Gabimaru.</p>
<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2><p>The ending is really well executed. Its so wholesome that you forget
that they once fought immortals. Yui was real after all, she was waiting
for Gabimaru to return. Sagiri and Yuzuriha went on a journey and part of it
was to stumble Gabimaru and his wife.</p>
