        <p>Tl;dr stop social media. Its meaningless and will ruin you internally like a plague.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been restricting myself from social media these days. This includes all
my online activity including youtube. Its all meaningless. Most people don&rsquo;t
find joy using social platforms, its just because they are bored. I unknowingly
became those npc. This is my way of taking my life back from this validation loop.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-social-media">What is social media?</h3><p>Thing that puts you in a fake validation loop to make you think that you are/have/will/might
achieve something when in fact you ultimately do nothing and scroll a 50mb app and <em>wait</em>
for something to happen so you could cure and grow your boredom.</p>
<p>Here is kind of detailed explanation <strong>what it really is</strong>
<a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1248481.pdf">https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1248481.pdf</a></p>
<h2 id="fake-belief">Fake belief</h2><p>Some say, one of the &ldquo;perk&rdquo; of social media is &ldquo;you will know whats happening on world&rdquo;. This
drives me nuts. There are 8 billion people on earth. Of course something is
always happening in world. Why do you need to know it? If its serious you will obviously
know it somehow or other. A good example is pre and post covid times.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-pattern-one-should-develop">Thinking pattern one should develop</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t care if you travel <a href="https://instagram.com">somewhere</a>. Its not me travelling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to listen to your opinions <a href="https://reddit.com/">[1]</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com">[2]</a>. Mine are plenty enough already.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to take part on your <a href="https://twitter.com">drama</a> nor do I wish to
know your <a href="https://youtube.com">daily life</a>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know something <a href="https://reddit.com/r/todayilearned/">meaningless</a>. (Basically every
productive reddit groups)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about your <a href="https://tiktok.com">dance</a> nor do I like those tryhard memes.</p>

<p><img src="wednesday.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So now what?</p>
<h2 id="what-worked-for-me">What worked for me</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve decided to read books. One of the main reason for not reading books was
literally the need for a library system. I wanted a fast book manager with
good reader. I once hacked my own but it was web based and pdf on web was
not a good experience. I am using <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">calibre</a> with
<a href="https://sioyek.info/">sioyek</a> now and I couldn&rsquo;t become more happier. Calibre
also has automatic feed to pdf thingy. I&rsquo;ve set it to fetch <a href="https://lwn.net/">lwn</a>
and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">hn</a> every friday to read. Plenty of news content
if something major happens :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also put the show bookmark to always in brave so I have something to click
when I&rsquo;m bored instead of going back to validation loop on some pathetic social
media.</p>
<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2><p>For others I would just say don&rsquo;t give more than 5 minutes to your social media
per day. It ruins your thinking pattern. Also think &ldquo;what will I gain from
this?&rdquo; everytime you consume any content. If its just for boredom then stop
that immediately and think what you really want to do and become&hellip; except npc
obviously. There are billion things that make you productive and happy from
simple things like understanding arts to learning mathematical concepts. You
just need to start somewhere.</p>
<h2 id="note">Note</h2><p><del>I kind of use <a href="https://social.linux.pizza/@prime_numbers">mastodon</a></del> just
because it doesn&rsquo;t provide any feedback loop or generalized content so I won&rsquo;t
spend more than 5 mins even if I want to. My home feed makes me smile and thats
what I all care. It should make you happy not guilty.</p>
